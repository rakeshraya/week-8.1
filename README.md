# Javascript data exercise 01

## Exercise 01 part 1

Navigate to a local directory where you want to store this exercise, and clone the repository from GitHub. Before you push, you will need to *change the GIT remote* to a new repository of your own with the following command: `git remote set-url origin [YOUR_REPO_URL_HERE]`.

This exercise reads in a JavaScript variable that contains university lecturers' names in a JSON-like string of data and turns this string into a JavaScript **object**.

The code given only picks one of the lecturers' names. The exercise is to loop through them all, display the result on the HTML page, and apply some basic CSS styles (e.g. using flexbox). As usual, read the comments in the code.

## Exercise 01 part 2

Add an extra property to the lecturers in 'data.js' - say a room number, an email address, a URL to their uni web page or (more abmitiously) a URL to an an image of each lecturer that links to their uni web page. Make this change show in your HTML file.
